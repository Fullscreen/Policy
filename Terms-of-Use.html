You understand that by posting information or content on the Website or otherwise providing content, materials or information to Company or in connection with the Services (collectively, “User Submissions”), Company hereby is and shall be granted a non exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable and transferable right to fully exploit such User Submissions (including all related intellectual property and proprietary rights) in connection with the Services, the Website, and Company’s (and its successors’ and assigns’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels; however, Company will only share your personally identifiable information in accordance with Company’s Privacy Policy in effect from time to time and located at http://fullscreenmedia.co/legal/#privacy-policy. You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Services, and to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under this Agreement. Furthermore, you understand that Company retains the right to reformat, modify, create derivative works of, excerpt, and translate any User Submissions submitted by you. For clarity, User Submissions exclude any of the videos which are or have been uploaded to your YouTube channel, and the foregoing license grant to Company does not affect your ownership of or right to grant additional licenses to the material in your User Submissions, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
<p>For clarity, the rights granted in this Section include, but are not limited to, the right: to use your name, image, voice, likeness, and any photographs or artwork made available by or on your behalf through the Services in connection with advertising, marketing, or promoting you, your User Submissions, Company, or the Services; to reproduce audio-visual content and sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), publicly perform sound recordings and videos (and the musical works embodied therein), and publicly display any written content uploaded by you to the Services, all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting Company the right to use the User Submissions without the obligation to pay any royalties to any copyright owner (including, without limitation, a publisher, record label or studio), any performing rights organization (a “PRO”, which term includes, without limitation, ASCAP, BMI and SESAC in the United States, and PRS in the United Kingdom), any sound recording PRO (including, without limitation, SoundExchange, Inc.), any unions or guilds (including, without limitation, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“AFTRA”), the Screen Actors Guild (“SAG”), the American Federation of Musicians (“AFM”), or any other engineers, producers or other participants involved in the creation of User Submissions or any element thereof.
<p>By uploading User Submissions through the Services you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Submissions. You further waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Submissions, or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, your name, likeness, voice, image, and persona or any advertising or publicity relating thereto. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Submissions. You expressly release Company and all of Company’s agents, partners, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensees, successors, and assigns from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and causes of action, whether now known or unknown, for defamation, copyright infringement, violation of moral rights, and invasion of the rights to privacy, publicity, or personality or any similar matter, or based upon or relating to the use of your User Submissions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section, you should let us know immediately if you object to any uses of your User Submissions on or through the Services or in the promotion of the Services.
<p>If you are not the owner of, or are not fully authorized to grant all necessary rights in, all of the elements of the User Submissions you intend to upload or transmit to or through the Services, then you must not upload the User Submissions to or through the Services. For example, if you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not upload such sound recordings or videos embodying such sound recordings to or through the Services unless you obtain all necessary rights, authorizations, and permissions with respect to such embedded musical works that grant you sufficient rights to comply with this Agreement. For example, cover songs are not permitted on the Services unless the artist/band has cleared all rights to the song covered by the artist/band. 1. Specific Rules for Musical Works: If you are a composer or author of a musical work and have affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free licenses granted by you to Company and users of the Services in this Agreement. Each PRO has different rules with respect to providing notification for a direct license. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free licenses set forth in this Agreement or have such music publisher enter into this Agreement with Company. Please keep in mind that authorship of a musical work (e.g., writing a song) does not mean that you have the rights necessary to grant Company and users of the Services the licenses set forth in this Agreement. 2. Confirmation of Rights: Company reserves the right to demand confirmation from you in writing of all authorizations, licenses, permissions, and consents obtained by you (if any) with respect to any third-party materials embodied in User Submissions. If you fail to provide Company with such confirmation upon request, we reserve the right to remove or deny access to any or all of your User Submissions and to suspend or terminate your account with Company. We will have no liability to you for any actions taken by us pursuant to this Section.
<p>You understand that all information publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated and that Company will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content.

<h2>9. Fees, Billing, and Payment</h2>
<strong>Paid Services:</strong> Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Currently, access to and participation in Paid Services (other than in connection with an Influencer Plus campaign) are subject to separate written agreements between you and Company, and you shall not be entitled to receive any Paid Services (other than in connection with an Influencer Plus campaign) in the absence of such an agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other agreement between you and Company, you will not be eligible to receive payment for any videos that you create or other services or content you provide as part of Influencer Plus if you have engaged in any act or omission that violates this Agreement or any other terms applicable to you in connection with the Services or any Influencer Plus campaign, or if you engage in any act or omission that negatively affects Company, the Services, or anyone advertising (or preparing to advertise) through the Services.

<h2>10. Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>The Services may contain links to third party websites or services (“Third Party Websites”) that are not owned or controlled by Company, or the Services may be accessible by logging in through a Third Party Website, as described more fully in our Privacy Policy. When you access Third Party Websites, you do so at your own risk. You hereby represent and warrant that you have read and agree to be bound by all applicable policies of any Third Party Websites relating to your use of the Services (“Third Party Policies”) and that you will act in accordance with those policies, in addition to your obligations under this Agreement. To the extent there is a conflict between any term in the Third Party Policies and this Agreement, the term in the Third Party Policies shall take precedence. Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, services, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any Third Party Websites. In addition, Company will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any Third Party Website. Company may modify or discontinue your use of, or access to, the Third Party Websites, or any content or services available thereunder, at any time in its sole absolute discretion with or without notice to you.
<p>By using the Services, you expressly relieve and hold harmless Company from any and all liability arising from your use of any Third Party Website. Except as described below, your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Company shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release Company, its officers, employees, agents, and successors in rights from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
<p>Company may, solely on behalf of certain Third Party Websites, process and facilitate payment to you of any amounts owed to you by such Third Party Websites (“Third Party Payments”). By entering into this Agreement, you authorize Company to process and facilitate the Third Party Payments to you. Such payments shall be made within sixty (60) days after Company receives such Third Party Payments from the respective Third Party Website. Company will make such payments through the payment method mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing, or such other payment method as Company may choose in its reasonable discretion. You acknowledge and agree that Company shall have no responsibility or liability for failure to facilitate the Third Party Payments to you if such failure is due to the respective Third Party Website’s failure to properly remit the Third Party Payments to Company. In the event your use of, or access to, the Services is terminated (whether initiated by you or Company), your use of, or access to, the Third Party Websites shall also cease, and Company shall have no responsibility or liability related to pending Third Party Payments owed to you from the respective Third Party Website. In the event of such termination, you shall be solely responsible for contacting the respective Third Party Website to provide updated contact and payment information such that you would receive such pending Third Party Payments directly from the respective Third Party Website.

<p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your use of the Services at any time. Company may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or your membership at any time, for any reason, and without warning, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership.

Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services, access the Website, and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
<h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference). If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Company’s prior written consent. Company may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement (provided that if a separate written agreement with respect to Company products or services exists between you and Company, the terms and conditions of that written agreement shall take precedence over this Agreement in the event of any conflict), and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any respect whatsoever. Headings for each section have been included above for your convenience, but such headings do not have any legal meaning, and may not accurately reflect the content of the provisions they precede.
<h2>13. Arbitration; Governing Law</h2>

(“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Central District of California.
<h2>14. Copyright Dispute Policy</h2>
<p>Company has adopted the following general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA (posted at https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/pl105-304.pdf). The address of Company’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (“Designated Agent”) is listed at the end of this Section. It is Company’s policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.
<strong>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:</strong>
<p>If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below: 1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed; 2. Identification of works or materials being infringed; 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Company is capable of finding and verifying its existence; 4. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address; 5. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 6. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
<strong>Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent:</strong>
<strong>It is Company’s policy:</strong>
<p>1. To remove or disable access to the infringing material; 2. To notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and 3. That repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Company will terminate such content provider’s, member’s or user’s access to the Services.
<strong>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</strong>
<p>If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider, member, or user, must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below: 1. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user; 2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled; 3. A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and 4. Content provider’s, member’s or user’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located, or, if the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company’s discretion.
