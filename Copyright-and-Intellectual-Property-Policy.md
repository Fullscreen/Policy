3. an identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Fullscreen to locate the material (for example, by providing a URL to the material); or, if applicable, identification of the reference or link to material or activity claimed to be infringing, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Fullscreen to locate that reference or link;
4. your name, address, telephone number, and email address;
5. a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright rights holder, its agent, or the law; and
